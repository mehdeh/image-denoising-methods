Ideal Denoiser Implementation (Equation 57 from EDM Paper).

This module implements the theoretical ideal denoiser from the paper:
"Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models"
by Karras et al., NeurIPS 2022.

The ideal denoiser computes the exact expected value of clean images given
noisy observations, using the closed-form solution from Appendix B.3, Eq. 57.

    Formula: D(x; σ) = E[x' | x], where x = x' + n with n ~ N(0, σ²I)

    """
    Ideal denoiser using closed-form solution from EDM paper (Eq. 57).
    
    This computes D(x; sigma) = E[x' | x], where x' ~ p_data and x = x' + n 
    with n ~ N(0, sigma^2 I).
    
    The formula from the paper:
    D(x; σ) = Σᵢ [N(x; xᵢ, σ²I) · xᵢ] / Σᵢ [N(x; xᵢ, σ²I)]
    
    Which expands to:
    D(x; σ) = Σᵢ [xᵢ · exp(-||x - xᵢ||² / (2σ²))] / Σᵢ [exp(-||x - xᵢ||² / (2σ²))]
    
    This is a weighted average of all training images, where the weights are
    proportional to the likelihood of each training image generating the observed
    noisy image under Gaussian noise.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    x_noisy : torch.Tensor
        Noisy input images of shape (batch_size, C, H, W)
    sigma : float or torch.Tensor
        Noise level (standard deviation)
    x_all : torch.Tensor
        All training images used as reference distribution of shape (num_samples, C, H, W)
        
    Returns:
    --------
    denoised : torch.Tensor
        Denoised images of shape (batch_size, C, H, W)
        
    Notes:
    ------
    - Uses log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability (subtracts max value before exp)
    - More numerically stable, especially for large distances or small sigma values
    - Computational complexity: O(N × B × C × H × W)
      where N is the number of training images and B is the batch size
    - Memory complexity: O(N × C × H × W)
    - Only feasible for small datasets like CIFAR-10

    ---------

    >>> from denoisers.ideal_denoiser import ideal_denoiser
    >>> from utils.noise_utils import add_gaussian_noise
    >>> 
    >>> # Create sample data
    >>> train_images = torch.randn(1000, 3, 32, 32)  # 1000 training images
    >>> test_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)  # 1 test image
    >>> 
    >>> # Add noise and denoise
    >>> sigma = 2.0
    >>> noisy_image = add_gaussian_noise(test_image, sigma)
    >>> denoised_image = ideal_denoiser(noisy_image, sigma, train_images)
